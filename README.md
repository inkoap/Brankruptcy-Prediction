# Brankruptcy Prediction

This project aims to develop a corporate bankruptcy prediction model. Through the analysis of financial data and related factors, this project seeks to assist businesses and financial institutions in identifying companies at high risk of bankruptcy in the future. By utilizing data analysis techniques and machine learning, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of a company's financial risk potential.

To achieve this goal, the project will collect and process financial data from various sources, such as financial reports, balance sheets, income statements, and other financial indicators. Furthermore, data exploration will be conducted to identify key factors correlated with the likelihood of bankruptcy. The prediction model to be developed will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of corporate bankruptcy based on historical data and related factors.

The results of this project are expected to provide significant benefits, especially to stakeholders involved in managing corporate financial risk, such as investors, creditors, and regulators. With a reliable prediction model in place, they can take preventive measures or make wiser decisions regarding investments or extending credit to companies that may potentially face bankruptcy. Additionally, this project can also help companies identify financial issues earlier and take necessary actions to avoid bankruptcy.
